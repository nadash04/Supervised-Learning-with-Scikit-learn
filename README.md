# Supervised-Learning-with-Scikit-learn


  Objective
Implement a **Linear Regression** and **Classification** model using real-world datasets.

 

  Datasets
1.  Boston Housing (Regression)  
   URL: [Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/DavidCico/Boston-House-Prices-With-Regression-Machine-Learning-and-Keras-Deep-Learning)

2.  Iris Dataset (Classification)  
   URL: [Iris Dataset](https://github.com/Apaulgithub/oibsip_taskno1/blob/main/Iris.csv)


Tasks
1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Split data into training and testing sets.  
3. Train a Linear Regression model on the Boston Housing dataset.  
4. Train a Classification model on the Iris dataset.  
5. Evaluate the models using:
   -  Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression  
   -  Accuracy  for classification  

 

 Deliverables
- Python scripts implementing the models.  
- Output showing evaluation metrics (MSE and Accuracy).  
- Brief summary of observations and conclusions.

 Libraries Used
- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn` (`LinearRegression`, `train_test_split`, `StandardScaler`, `accuracy_score`)  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` (for visualizations)  

 

 How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
